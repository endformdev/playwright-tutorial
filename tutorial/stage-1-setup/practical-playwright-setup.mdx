In this part of the tutorial, we will both set up a Playwright project from scratch, but we will also learn to use the most important features to be more productive with Playwright when using a real-world application.

Some Playwright features we will cover include:

- Automatically creating and deleting test users
- Using `storageState`
- Playwright projects & global setup

Let's get started!
