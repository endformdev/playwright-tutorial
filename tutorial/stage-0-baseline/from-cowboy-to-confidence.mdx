_Maybe you're a bit of a cowboy._

Maybe you already have unit and integration tests, but you still keep running through user flows manually in your browser.

Or you're a more seasoned Playwright tester, but you're looking to brush up on the latest and greatest, and improve your setup. 

In this tutorial, we will end-to-end test a realistic software as a service application from scratch.
We will cover all of the Playwright features that you need to be productive in your day to day. 

So come along, and let's get you from cowboy to confidence.

## Source code

The full repository for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/endformdev/saas-starter-playwright). 

The repository contains a software as a service application that has login logout, user modification and checkout functionality. 
The application is built with Next.js and can either be run locally from your command line or you can test against our pre-deployed version of it. 

## Choose where to start

Each step of the tutorial has a [branch associated with it](https://github.com/endformdev/saas-starter-playwright/branches), with all of the work included from the previous tutorial steps. 
You can choose to start from the beginning, or you can start from a specific step, depending on what you're interested in and what your previous experiences with playwright are.
