In this guide, we will use the Playwright MCP to generate tests for your application.

<Aside>
To start from this step, checkout the [`stage-1-setup` branch](https://github.com/endformdev/playwright-tutorial/tree/stage-1-setup) of the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/endformdev/playwright-tutorial).

</Aside>

## Setting up the Playwright MCP Server

In this part of the tutorial, we will be using the [Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).

We will use Cursor for the purposes of this tutorial, but you could use any IDE or CLI tool that supports MCP in its place.

Be sure to check out the installation instructions in the [Playwright MCP repository](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) to correctly set up the Playwright MCP server before continuing.

For example for Cursor, your `mcp.json` file could look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Authenticating with the Playwright MCP Server

At the time of writing, the Playwright MCP server doesn't have support for the projects or storage states that we set up in our Playwright config in the previous step. 

You can achieve something similar by using the following flags to the MCP server:

```
--isolated                   keep the browser profile in memory, do not save it to disk.
--storage-state <path>       path to the storage state file for isolated sessions.
```

Our mcp command with these arguments could look like this:

```
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated --storage-state .auth/api-user.json
```

It's just that at the moment, our projects are configured to create and delete users during the course of a suite run, so that user won't exist!

Let's add a script to help us create and remove users for the MCP server when we need them.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="mcp-user.ts (Hint)">
```ts
// import existing user creation and deletion functions

const scriptArg = process.argv[2];

if (scriptArg !== "create" && scriptArg !== "delete") {
	console.error(
		`Error: Invalid argument "${scriptArg}". Expected "create" or "delete".`,
	);
	process.exit(1);
}

// create or delete user based on script arg
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mcp-user.ts (Completed)">
```ts
import { createUser, deleteUser } from "./setup-utils";

const scriptArg = process.argv[2];

if (scriptArg !== "create" && scriptArg !== "delete") {
	console.error(
		`Error: Invalid argument "${scriptArg}". Expected "create" or "delete".`,
	);
	process.exit(1);
}

// Can you come up with a way of getting the baseURL from the playwright.config.ts file
// instead of hardcoding it here?
const baseURL = "https://endform-playwright-tutorial.vercel.app";

if (scriptArg === "create") {
	await createUser(baseURL, "mcp");
} else if (scriptArg === "delete") {
	await deleteUser(baseURL, "mcp");
}

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we can make an mcp user by running:

```bash
bun run mcp-user create
```

And delete it by running:

```bash
bun run mcp-user delete
```

Don't forget to update our MCP server configuration for our new user.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state",
        "/full/path/to/your/project/.auth/mcp-user.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Generating our first test

Now that we have an MCP user saved to a file and our MCP server configured to use that storage state file when running the browser,
we are in a good position to start generating tests that require authenticated users.

When using an AI in tandem with an MCP server, it's a good idea to take the time to craft a good prompt to help your AI as much as possible when you're trying to generate tests.

Here we will be inspired by [Debbie from the Playwright team's prompts](https://github.com/debs-obrien/playwright-mcp-prompts/blob/main/.github/prompts/generate-tests.prompt.md) to get started:

#### Test generation background

Start with the requirements we have on the LLM:

```
# Test Generation with Playwright MCP

Generate comprehensive Playwright tests for one scenario by following a systematic exploration and testing workflow.

## Process Overview

You will be given a testing scenario. Your task is to:

1. **Explore First** - Use Playwright MCP tools to navigate and understand the website
2. **Generate Tests** - Create a well-structured TypeScript test using `@playwright/test` for that one scenario
3. **Validate** - Execute test and iterate until it passes consistently
4. **Refine** - Ensure test follows best practices and is maintainable

## Critical Requirements

- **Always explore the website first** - Never generate tests based solely on scenario descriptions
- **Use systematic exploration** - Navigate, take snapshots, and understand the application flow
- **Focus on one scenario** - Generate tests for the specific scenario provided
- **Save to tests directory** - All generated test files go in the `tests/` folder
- **Iterate until passing** - Run tests and fix issues until they pass consistently

## Success Criteria

- Tests use accessibility-first locators (getByRole, getByLabel, etc.)
- Tests follow proper structure with describe blocks and test steps
- Tests include meaningful assertions that reflect user expectations
- Tests are resilient and maintainable
- All tests pass consistently when executed
```

#### Setup information

Then include some information about our setup

```
# Setup information
- Our website is available at https://endform-playwright-tutorial.vercel.app
- You are already logged in as a temporary user
```

#### The test scenario

Finally, we should provide a detailed description of the test scenario we want to generate tests for.

```
# Test scenario
- Navigate to the dashboard.
- Navigate to the activity section.
- Verify that one of the elements in the activity section is "you signed up". 
- Verify that one of the elements in the activity section is "you created a new team". 
```

Feed all these bits together to the prompt, and see what the AI generates!

Here's an example of what it could look like in cursor:

<Image src={CursorActivityTodo} alt="A to-do list generated by an AI agent inside of the cursor IDE" width={600} />

Here's a generated test that I got back from the AI. Can you spot any major flaws that we need to fix?

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="activity-section.spec.ts (Generated)">
```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Activity Section", () => {
	test("should navigate to dashboard activity section and verify user activities", async ({
		page,
	}) => {
		await test.step("navigate to the dashboard", async () => {
			await page.goto("/dashboard");
			await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard");
			await expect(
				page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Team Settings" }),
			).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("navigate to the activity section", async () => {
			await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Activity" }).click();
			await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard/activity");
			await expect(
				page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Activity Log" }),
			).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify activity section contains expected elements", async () => {
			await expect(page.getByText("Recent Activity")).toBeVisible();

			const activityList = page.getByRole("list");
			await expect(activityList).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify 'you signed up' activity is present", async () => {
			const signupActivity = page.getByRole("listitem").filter({
				hasText: "You signed up",
			});
			await expect(signupActivity).toBeVisible();

			await expect(signupActivity.getByText("You signed up")).toBeVisible();
			await expect(signupActivity.getByText("just now")).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify 'you created a new team' activity is present", async () => {
			const teamCreationActivity = page.getByRole("listitem").filter({
				hasText: "You created a new team",
			});
			await expect(teamCreationActivity).toBeVisible();

			await expect(
				teamCreationActivity.getByText("You created a new team"),
			).toBeVisible();
			await expect(teamCreationActivity.getByText("just now")).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify both activities are present in the activity log", async () => {
			const activityItems = page.getByRole("listitem");
			await expect(activityItems).toHaveCount(2);

			// Verify both texts exist on the page
			await expect(page.getByText("You signed up")).toBeVisible();
			await expect(page.getByText("You created a new team")).toBeVisible();
		});
	});
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="activity-section.spec.ts (Fixed)">
```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Activity Section", () => {
	test("should navigate to dashboard activity section and verify user activities", async ({
		page,
	}) => {
		await test.step("navigate to the dashboard", async () => {
			await page.goto("/dashboard");
			await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard");
			await expect(
				page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Team Settings" }),
			).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("navigate to the activity section", async () => {
			await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Activity" }).click();
			await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard/activity");
			await expect(
				page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Activity Log" }),
			).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify activity section contains expected elements", async () => {
			await expect(page.getByText("Recent Activity")).toBeVisible();

			const activityList = page.getByRole("list");
			await expect(activityList).toBeVisible();
		});

		await test.step("verify 'you signed up' activity is present", async () => {
			const signupActivity = page.getByRole("listitem").filter({
				hasText: "You signed up",
			});
			await expect(signupActivity).toBeVisible();

			await expect(signupActivity.getByText("You signed up")).toBeVisible();
			// Just now might not always be the matching time string - let's not check for it
		});

		await test.step("verify 'you created a new team' activity is present", async () => {
			const teamCreationActivity = page.getByRole("listitem").filter({
				hasText: "You created a new team",
			});
			await expect(teamCreationActivity).toBeVisible();

			await expect(
				teamCreationActivity.getByText("You created a new team"),
			).toBeVisible();
			// Just now might not always be the matching time string - let's not check for it
		});

		// The extra step is a bit unnecessary, would be a shame if this test failed because more activities were added
	});
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Otherwise, it was a pretty good test - we've got solid, modern locators and it's labelling steps in a an understandable way.

## Generating more tests

Here are a few more prompts you can try out to generate more tests (don't forget to add the rest of the setup & background information from the previous steps):

#### Change the password
```
# Test scenario
- Navigate to the dashboard.
- Navigate to the general section.
- Check what my current email is and make a copy of it.
- Navigate to the security page.
- Change the password to "newpassword123".
- The current password is "testpassword123".
- Sign out.
- Sign in with the new password and the email we copied earlier.
- Verify that we are logged in.
```


## List of bugs we found and fixed in the course of generating these tests

Just by creating this section and generating more tests for this application, we discovered several bugs in the application itself that were preventing the tests from working.
In real world scenarios, this is why making tests is a great exercise.
We won't force you to learn the intricacies of this application and Next.js to be able to write your tests.
Instead, here's a list of bugs we fixed to give you an idea of the kinds of problems that you might encounter when creating tests like these for your own website.

- User activities weren't always created - race condition
- Users couldn't not be deleted when activities existed, foreign key constraint
- The user menu wouldn't collapse on click

Other classic problems with the tests that the AI generated:

- Strict mode violations / more than one element on the page that matches a locator
- Adding manual timeouts to tests instead of crafting good assertions
- Hardcoding urls instead of using relative paths
