# Running Tests with Endform

In this stage, you'll integrate your Playwright tests with Endform, a powerful platform for running end-to-end tests at scale. You'll learn how to configure local test execution, set up GitHub Actions workflows, and monitor test results through Endform's dashboard.

## Learning Objectives

- Configure your project for Endform integration
- Set up local test execution with Endform
- Create GitHub Actions workflows for continuous testing
- Monitor and analyze test results
- Handle test failures and debugging

## What is Endform?

Endform is a platform-as-a-service solution for running Playwright tests at scale. It provides:

- Parallel test execution across multiple environments
- Advanced debugging and tracing capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time test monitoring and analytics
- Scalable infrastructure for large test suites

## Prerequisites

Before starting this stage, ensure you have:
- Completed Stage 2 (Generated tests)
- An Endform account
- Tests ready to run
- GitHub repository set up

## Endform Configuration

*Content for this stage will be added when implementing the actual Endform integration.*

## What's Next?

In the final stage, you'll learn how to use Endform's dashboard for debugging, analytics, and test optimization.
