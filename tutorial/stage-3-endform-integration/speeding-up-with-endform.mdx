In this guide, we will use endform to speed up your test suite.

<Aside>
To start from this step, checkout the [`stage-2-generated-tests` branch](https://github.com/endformdev/playwright-tutorial/tree/stage-2-generated-tests) of the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/endformdev/playwright-tutorial).
For more information about getting started with the tutorial repository, go [here](/docs/tutorial/from-cowboy-to-confidence#getting-started-with-the-tutorial-repository).

At this point in time, we have a pretty decent Playwriht end to end testing suite that can test most of the dummy features in this application.
We can test complex multi user flows like inviting, and we have the ability to create new users on demand when the user data conflicts with other tests.
